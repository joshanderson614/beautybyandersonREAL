# Beauty by Anderson – Netlify config
# Netlify Forms: form is detected from the hidden form in index.html at deploy time.
# Do NOT add redirects that would turn POST / into a 301/302 (that breaks form submission).
# A rewrite like /* /index.html 200 is OK: POST to / still hits the origin and Forms still work.
